### Download and install Desktop versions

See [desktop run information](desktop/RUN.md)

### App store beta channels

Every new release is first uploaded to the App Store beta channels and tested for around two weeks.

You can be the first to try new features and help to get this wallet better by joining the beta channels. 

[Apple TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/join/K5uBKWJ5)

On Google Play, open the App Details page on an Android device and find the "Join beta" button.

### Download and install the Android APK manually

Apart from Google Play, you can download the app APKs from the [releases section](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet-app/releases) to sideload.
There are APKs available for Testnet and Mainnet, and as a debug build and release build.

**Debug builds** are built on GitHub.
It is normal that Google Play Protect warns about
an unsafe app. GitHub builds the binaries with a certificate unknown to Google.
Because the certificate changes, you can't upgrade the app later - you need to uninstall and install fresh.

**Release builds** are built by me with my developer certificate and minified. This should reduce
Google Play Protect warnings, you'll be able to upgrade without losing your data and the app is
much smaller and faster, however, you have to trust me.

The APK file can be installed on your Android device. If you sideload for the first time,
[you can follow this guide](https://www.xda-developers.com/sideload-apps-how-to/).

### Build yourself

* [Android](android/BUILD.md)
* [iOS](ios/BUILD.md)
* [Desktop](desktop/BUILD.md)

### Translations

Every translation is welcome! There is a single 
[strings file to translate](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet-app/blob/develop/android/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) 
to your language.

Either send me the translated file on Discord or Telegram, or open a PR here. For this, move the 
file to a values-xx directory where xx is your language's ISO code. 
([Spanish example](https://github.com/ergoplatform/ergo-wallet-app/tree/develop/android/src/main/res/values-es))
